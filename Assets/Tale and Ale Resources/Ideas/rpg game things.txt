All spells function by ID. When pressed, if ID = X, somethng happens.
Also, when changing a spell, change its animation.
Ez to me.

Create a default spellList with 20 Attack spells.
At the start of the combat, copy the spellList into another list called currentDeck and shuffle currentDeck.
__To Do__
Manually set the 5 spells to the first 5 items in currentDeck and remove them.
When a spell is used, extract the first spell from currentDeck and replace that spell with it.



Loot: 3 types of loot:
	Blue Orbs: Xp
	Orange Orbs: Random Weapon Upgrades (get upgrade and its done)
	Red Orbs: Abilities
	Green Orbs: Talents and upgrades for abilities.
You choose between 3 chests containing combinations of orbs and sometimes direct upgrades.

__TO DO__
  make upgrades as images, not text. you choose 1 of 3 random when you choose to buy an upgrade. you also see them as images.	(done)
o When you get an upgrade add it to the upgrades list.	(done)
o When calculating stats, iterate through each upgrade and use a switch on them. (done)
o In character management, put many upgrade actors and add them to an Actor list. (done)
o For upgrade #1 in your list, set the animation of UpgradeActor #1 to the value of upgrade #1.				(done)
Make this scrollable. Make the scene extend down and make a scroll thingy.
o Also make a shop for all of this	(done)


- The ability management screen currently displays your 20 abilities equipped. Put them in a list for ease of use.	(done)
- Make an event for clicking each ability (sucks, i know). That event sets a SelectedAbility (ID) to the corresponding one from the spellList. This also changes the tooltip.	(done)
- Make a REMOVE button. This removes that SelectedAbility (ID) from the list. Then refresh the 20 abilities.
HINT: this will work because order doesn't matter
- When you buy an ability, you get to choose between 3 abilities. The one you choose is automatically added to your ability pool.	(done)


__TO DO__
- Improve the usability of the ability section: add tooltips and a remove button	(1/2)
- Write the uContains, tContains, sContains functions so you can check existing talents easier	(not nec)
- perhaps make the database of descriptions global in code instead of a global list attribute.	(not nec)

_TO DO_
-Ability page remove button			(done)
-script the stunning system for combat	
-look at pokemon and make combat like there.	(done)
	-health bar base is done and scripted, script the rest

__TO DO__
-further improve the combat game feels!! (its currently pretty good)
	play with screen shake intensities adn time it takes for all to work out.
-script the game feel for enemy too			(done)
-eventually put them in different reusable functions	(not nec)
-after the player spells tehre's a "do after". calculate how much time it takes for player's action to resolve, and enemy's too and fix time issues.	(done/not nec)
-also add a "do after" for "check if combat is done"	(done)
-script the stun system					(done)
-add tooltips to the abilities section			(done)
-add a screenshake and chest breaking when you open it (4 pieces, 4 actors i mean)								(done)
-fix screenshake borders
-make the combat text a text box			(done)
-make the hp bar move at heals too			(1/2)
-keep the health form fight to fight			(done)
-give the stun part a nice animation (down, then up)
-BUGFIX: the damage from bleeds should be different from normal damage functions!!!
--design enemies and bosses
--design spells: think of cool ways to build ur charactir.
--the talent system is class-specific
--when u buy an ab/upgrade/talent, make the orbs go nicely from left to right
--blood and bigger crits
--enemy quotes in combat ("god forgive my sins...")
--stand animations also slightly increase width and height like breathing cube

pretty standard strategy. 

Announce well before release and gain interest. Do a press release to get articles written.

Next, constantly push updates, trailers, gameplay demos etc.

Then send out press copies ahead of launch so they have time to play and review it. That way you get a ton of reviews from big people on day one.

Release with a launch trailer and another press release.

Then you make money

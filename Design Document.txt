- [ TILE PIECE 2 UNLOCKED ]
o We have 2 pieces.
o We need 2 more.

  3.1. Encounter with Marceline
- Thanks for beating that jerk's ass.
- Here
- [ SOME POWER UNLOCKED ]
- Now then...
- I'll get back to my business destroying my father's kingdom
o Wait!
o Why are you doing this?

- Hundreds of years ago...
- My father's ancestors made a pact with an ancient demon
- Tyl, the Tile Demon
- That's how they built the kingdom, and the castle
- And now, the time has come to pay the price.
- Tyl, the Tile Demon wants to redeem the kingdom.
- That's the reason for all this corruption
- For all these monsters

o So when the King excavated the tile...
o The corruption came out to get the kingdom...
- It was inevitable.
- I broke the tile into 4 pieces so I can destroy the kingdom...
- I have a tile piece...
- With it, I can control a part of the corruption to destroy the kingdom.
o What happens if we assemble the tile back?
- If you put that tile back where it was...
- You will stop the corruption...
o Perfect!
- BUT...
- ...only until someone else finds the tile!
- And this chaos will return!
- One day, in the future, someone will find the tile again.
- And the corruption will emerge once more!
- Everything we suffered through will be in vain!

- The only solution to all of this is to destroy the whole kingdom.
- And end the demon pact once and for all!
o So...
o You want to destroy the kingdom, so the demon can't have it?
- Exactly!
o There must be another way!
- You don't get it!
- This kingdom is a ticking time bomb for the demon!
o Come with us! Let's destroy Tyl, together!
- Fools!
- You can't hope to fight such powers!
o We will try!



  3.2. Spatula Death
- My powers weaken...
o Now, let go of the monsters' souls!
- I want to... but... I can't!
o Do it!
o Free Stormjr
- In the name of the demon lord, Tyl...
- I abandon my control over Stormjr's soul...
o Yes!
- And I forward it to Tyl, the Tile Demon!
o No!
o OH, COME ON!
- After all that was given to me...
- I now stand to lose it all...
[ BONK - comes the king and bonks Spatula in his head with the spoon ]

- Good work, adventurers!
- Now, we have the ashes necessary to reveal Father Almund.
o Hold up.
o Tyl, the Tile Demon is the master of it all!
- It seems so...
o And you lied to us about the tile.
- ...
o You told us the tile was shattered into 4 pieces.
o It was actually Marceline who did it...
o ...to keep you away from reassembling the tile...
o ...and postponing the evil.
- ...
- Yes. I know.
- I feared you may not understand.
- But you have to understand.
- It was all for her good, and the good of the kingdom.

- Either we assemble the tile and seal the evil temporarily...
- ...or we destroy the kingdom, so Tyl can't have it.
- If you were the king, what would you choose?
o ...
- I thought so...

- Now then,
- Only 2 pieces remain to be found.
- Father Almund has one...
- ...and Marceline has the last one.
- I fear we will have to make a grave choice soon...

- Go back to the villages.
- With the vampire's ashes, I will reveal the path to Almund.
- Take great care.
- He is a man of great wisdom, and great power.

    Act III
  1.1. Father Almund meeting
- Our Lord and Savior, hear us...
- In these dark moments, deliver us from evil...
- Oh, Lord...
- Why won't you answer?

- A dark whisper at the back of my head.
- If only this Tile Shard could empower my faith...
- ...as much as it has empowered my body.

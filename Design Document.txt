Ideas:
    - Make the player hate the villain!
    - If the game is roguelike (learn by dying), have big power spikes/strategy changing items/abilities!

Enemy Abilities:
    - Deal with me last: e.g. loses power with each dead ally
    - Deal with me first: healer, high damage/low hp, enrages after every ally death
    
Player powers:
    - Shooting the same enemy 2 turns in a row crits!
    - Flanking an enemy deals extra damage!



Encounters:
  Each BattlefieldEncounter holds one wave of enemies (hasNextWave = true)
  The next wave is the next wave in the database, in order
  If a BattlefieldEncounter doesn't have another wave
